I think I am going to make an iOS application for Regex puzzles. I really like doing Regex puzzles and I enjoy building iOS applications, so naturally this is a good choice for me. I hope that this is a valid project just because the other
option that I was considering is an iOS framework for location based data or
something along those lines just because I feel that it might be useful in my other project that I am planning on doing later, independent of RPI coursework.
